Welcome to Radiant Health! Please read the following before getting started:-

How to run the app?
You can launch the app by simply opening index.html. Please note that you have to be connected to the internet to fully access the app because this app uses a charting library called CanvasJS which is retrieved from the web when the app launches.

Once you are in the app, you are greeted with a Profile/Goals page where you can set your name, age, height, weight, and your daily health goals by clicking on the Edit button.

When the goals are set, you can click on the Back button which will lead you to the home screen. The red hotspots represent the unmet goals for the day. You can click on them to see what they represent.

You can access the different parts of the app either by clicking on the dots or by navigating the hamburger menu in the top left. In the menu, you can click on your name to go to the Profile/Goals page. Clicking on the Goals button would take you to the same page. In this prototype, you cannot change or upload a new profile picture to personalize the app.

Clicking on the Medication button will take you to the Medication page. You can enter how many pills you have left and how many pills you need to take daily by clicking on the Edit button. Once you have done that, you can click on Done to save that. And to log your daily pills, all you have to do is click on the Pills Taken Today button and you are done! At the moment, the prototype can handle only one prescription, which is why the arrow button and the plus button(in edit mode) are greyed out. Clicking on the Back button will bring you back to the home page.

Clicking on the Steps button in the menu would take you to the Steps page. The Steps page does not have any edit button because the hope is that the steps are tracked automatically via your phone sensors and you don't have to log anything. You can click on the Past Data button to view your past statistics. Clicking on the Back button will bring you back to the home page.

Clicking on the Levels button in the menu would take you to the Floors page. The Floors page does not have any edit button because the hope is that the floors climbed are tracked automatically via your phone sensors and you don't have to log anything. You can click on the Past Data button to view your past statistics. Clicking on the Back button will bring you back to the home page.

Clicking on the Water button in the menu would take you to the Water page. You can simply click on Add a Glass button to log when you have drank a glass of water. When the goal is met, the glass is filled with water to the brim to indicate that you have met the daily goal you set for yourself. Right now, the app only supports 10 glasses of water daily. You can click on the Past Data button to view the past statistics. The water intake is also reflected on the graph, albeit on a different day and date. This is because the rest of the data was hardcoded into the graph and so it does not reflect the actual day and date. But the goal tracking shows partial implementation. Clicking on the Back button will bring you back to the home page.

Once a goal is met and you go to the home page, you are met with a firework GIF to show that you completed a goal for the day and the red dot for that goal disappears. The completed goal is also represented in the hamburger menu with a green border on the button.

The graphs are currently hardcoded and not fully implemented to reflect actual date and days of the week and don't have the ability to save data over days. They can however handle storing the data for a single day.
